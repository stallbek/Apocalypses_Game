Developed an algorithm-based game in Java that calculates the optimal path from point A to point B, incorporating additional waypoints, tailored to the user’s objectives, such as the fastest or shortest path.
This project extensively utilized core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and implemented a variety of algorithms and data structures. Key algorithms included Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs, as well as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for exploring graph structures. Advanced data structures such as binary search trees, heaps, hashmaps, and hashsets were employed to optimize performance and enhance functionality. The solution emphasized modularity, efficiency, and scalability, ensuring robust computation across varying scenarios.
